# @templatical/editor

## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 058dfff: This release bundles three changes: an OSS/Cloud locale split, a fix for missing custom blocks in MJML/JSON exports, and a fix for incorrect background-color attributes on inner MJML elements.

  ## OSS/Cloud locale split

  Split `@templatical/editor` translations into OSS and cloud chunks so external locale contributions only need to cover the open-source surface.

  **Editor i18n changes**
  - Added `packages/editor/src/i18n/locales/cloud/{en,de}.ts` containing strings used only by `initCloud()` features: AI chat / rewrite / menu, comments, collaboration, scoring, snapshots, plan limits (`header.*`), test email, saved modules, design reference, cloud loading/error overlays. These groups were removed from the OSS `locales/{en,de}.ts`.
  - New exports from `@templatical/editor`: `loadCloudTranslations(locale)`, `getSupportedCloudLocales()`, `isCloudLocaleSupported(locale)`, type `CloudTranslations`.
  - New injection key `CLOUD_TRANSLATIONS_KEY` and composables `useCloudI18n()` (returns `CloudTranslations | null` for shared components that conditionally render cloud UI) / `useCloudI18nStrict()` (throws if not provided, for cloud-only components).
  - `initCloud()` now loads OSS + cloud translation chunks in parallel and provides both. `init()` (OSS) loads only the OSS chunk — the cloud strings are tree-shaken from the OSS bundle.
  - Supported-locale lists are auto-derived via `import.meta.glob`. OSS and cloud locales are tracked separately, so an OSS-only contributor adding `locales/fr.ts` without `locales/cloud/fr.ts` ships a French OSS UI while the cloud chunk gracefully falls back to English at runtime.

  **Locale parity enforcement**
  - Type-driven: every non-`en` locale file is now annotated `: typeof en` so missing/extra/mistyped keys fail `pnpm run typecheck`.
  - Runtime: `tests/i18n.test.ts` discovers locale files via `import.meta.glob` and asserts nested-key parity plus per-key `{placeholder}` parity. OSS parity is hard-required; cloud parity is skip-if-absent (only enforced for cloud locales that exist on disk). Same pattern applied to `@templatical/media-library`.

  **Migration notes for embedders**
  - No public API removals. `Translations`, `useI18n()`, `loadTranslations()`, `getSupportedLocales()`, `isLocaleSupported()`, `TRANSLATIONS_KEY` keep their previous names and behavior — they just refer to the OSS surface now.
  - If you imported cloud-only string paths through `Translations` (e.g. `t.aiChat.title`), switch to `useCloudI18n()` / `useCloudI18nStrict()`. Within `initCloud()` the cloud strings are still available; they are no longer present on the OSS `Translations` type.
  - Existing locale overrides passed to `init()` / `initCloud()` continue to work. Cloud overrides are not yet a supported public input — only locale strings are.

  ## Custom blocks now appear in MJML/JSON exports

  Custom blocks were missing from MJML/JSON exports because their rendered HTML was never persisted from the editor's UI ref into the export pipeline. The fix moves custom-block resolution into the renderer itself as an explicit contract.

  **Renderer**
  - `renderToMjml(content, options?)` is now **async** (`Promise<string>`). Custom blocks may need async resolution.
  - New `RenderOptions.renderCustomBlock?: (block: CustomBlock) => Promise<string>` option. The renderer walks the tree, awaits all custom-block resolutions in parallel, then runs the existing sync render pass.
  - If no callback is provided, the renderer falls back to `block.renderedHtml` (if present) and otherwise omits the custom block from output.

  **Editor**
  - `editor.toMjml()` is now `Promise<string>` (was sync), always present (was optional). Wires the editor's internal block registry into the renderer's `renderCustomBlock` callback automatically.
  - If `@templatical/renderer` is not installed, `toMjml()` throws a clear error — the renderer remains an optional peer dependency.
  - New method `editor.renderCustomBlock(block): Promise<string>` for headless callers that want to drive the renderer directly while reusing the editor's registry.
  - The Cloud editor does **not** expose `toMjml()` — the cloud backend handles MJML conversion server-side with additional processing (signed image URLs, asset rewriting). Use the OSS `init()` if you want client-side export.

  **Migration**
  - Add `await` everywhere you call `editor.toMjml()` or `renderToMjml(content)`.
  - Drop any optional-chain (`editor.toMjml?.()`) — the method is always defined now.
  - Headless / Node.js consumers calling `renderToMjml` directly with custom blocks should pass a `renderCustomBlock` resolver (e.g. a Liquid engine running against `block.fieldValues`) — see the renderer README for the full pattern.

  ## MJML inner-element background colors now render correctly

  Inner MJML elements (`mj-text`, `mj-image`, `mj-table`, `mj-navbar`, `mj-video`) only support `container-background-color` per the MJML spec; passing `background-color` was silently dropped by MJML compilers, leaving the rendered email's `<td>` wrapper without a background. The renderer now emits the correct attribute. `mj-section` and `mj-button` continue to use the native `background-color` attribute they natively support.

  The rule is centralized in a new `bgAttr(color, "container" | "native")` helper so future renderers can't regress, and round-trip MJML→HTML compile tests (`tests/mjml-bg-roundtrip.test.ts`) catch the silent-drop class of bug.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 31a59c0: Fix editor interactivity broken in 0.1.1.

  In 0.1.1 we bundled Vue inline but left `@templatical/core` and `@templatical/types` as external dependencies. Because `@templatical/core` imports reactivity primitives from `@vue/reactivity` (the standalone package), and the editor bundle shipped Vue's full runtime (which contains its own copy of the reactivity system), consumers ended up with **two separate reactivity instances at runtime** — each with its own dep-tracking `WeakMap`. Refs created by `@templatical/core`'s `useEditor` were never tracked by the editor's render functions, so clicks, drags, and every state mutation silently no-op'd: the editor rendered initial chrome but ignored all user input.

  This release bundles `@templatical/core`, `@templatical/types`, and all transitive Vue libraries (`@vueuse/core`, `vuedraggable`, `@tiptap/*`, `@lucide/vue`) **inline** into the editor's npm entry, with `vue` and `@vue/reactivity` deduped to a single instance via Vite's `resolve.dedupe`. The editor is now a truly self-contained drop-in:
  - Consumer install drops from 149 → 71 packages (no `vue`, no `@vue/*`, no `@tiptap/*`, no `@templatical/core`/`types` in `node_modules`).
  - Zero peer warnings on `npm install @templatical/editor` for any framework (React, Svelte, Angular, vanilla, Vue).
  - Interactivity works in every consumer setup verified — including a React app with `<div id="editor" />` rendered as a JSX child inside the React tree.

  The only externals that remain are the optional cloud/feature peers a consumer explicitly opts into: `@templatical/media-library`, `@templatical/renderer`, `pusher-js`.

  **Note for SDK contributors:** when adding a new runtime dependency to the editor that uses Vue's reactivity (or imports from `@vue/reactivity` directly), it MUST be bundled inline (i.e. listed in `devDependencies`, not `dependencies`, and not in `rolldownOptions.external`). Adding such a dep as a runtime/peer dep reintroduces the duplicate-reactivity bug.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- bdb338b: Fix consumer install/bundle of `@templatical/editor`.
  - **`@templatical/editor`/style.css export** — CSS now emits as `dist/style.css` so the `./style.css` subpath export resolves. Previously emitted as `dist/templatical-editor.css`, causing 404s for `import '@templatical/editor/style.css'` and breaking sandbox bundlers (bundlephobia, bundlejs).
  - **`@templatical/editor` peer deps** — `vue` and `tailwindcss` removed from `peerDependencies`. Vue is now bundled into the npm entry; Tailwind is build-time only (CSS already compiled). `npm install @templatical/editor` is now a complete install for any consumer (React, Svelte, Angular, vanilla, Vue) with no peer warnings. **Note for Vue app consumers:** Vue is now isolated inside the editor (Stripe-Elements pattern). Your Vue tree is unaffected, but Vue is shipped twice (~80KB gz duplicated).
  - **`@templatical/core`/cloud pusher-js** — clearer error when cloud features are used without the `pusher-js` optional peer installed.
