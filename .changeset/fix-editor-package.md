Fix consumer install/bundle of `@templatical/editor`.

- **`@templatical/editor`/style.css export** — CSS now emits as `dist/style.css` so the `./style.css` subpath export resolves. Previously emitted as `dist/templatical-editor.css`, causing 404s for `import '@templatical/editor/style.css'` and breaking sandbox bundlers (bundlephobia, bundlejs).
- **`@templatical/editor` peer deps** — `vue` and `tailwindcss` removed from `peerDependencies`. Vue is now bundled into the npm entry; Tailwind is build-time only (CSS already compiled). `npm install @templatical/editor` is now a complete install for any consumer (React, Svelte, Angular, vanilla, Vue) with no peer warnings. **Note for Vue app consumers:** Vue is now isolated inside the editor (Stripe-Elements pattern). Your Vue tree is unaffected, but Vue is shipped twice (~80KB gz duplicated).
- **`@templatical/core`/cloud pusher-js** — clearer error when cloud features are used without the `pusher-js` optional peer installed.
