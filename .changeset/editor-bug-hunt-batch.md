Batch of bug fixes hardening editor correctness and security:

- **Link dialog rejects dangerous URL schemes.** `javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:`, `file:` (plus case-bypasses like `JaVaScRiPt:` and whitespace-padded variants) are now dropped at link-insert time. Safe schemes (`http`, `https`, `mailto`, `tel`, `ftp`, `ftps`, `sms`, `xmpp`, `cid`) and `#` anchors still pass through.
- **`v-html` content sanitized before render.** `ParagraphBlock` and `TitleBlock` now scrub `<script>`/`<style>`/`<iframe>`/`on*` event handlers and unsafe `href` / `src` schemes from `block.content` before binding it to `v-html`. Closes the XSS path where a malicious or compromised template JSON could execute code on canvas load. TipTap-authored content (the common case) is unaffected.
- **Block duplication regenerates nested IDs.** Cloning a `table`, `social`, or `menu` block previously reused identical `rows[].id` / `cells[].id` / `icons[].id` / `items[].id` from the source, violating the unique-id invariant.
- **Removing a section clears descendant selection.** Previously, deleting an ancestor with a child selected left `selectedBlockId` dangling on the now-orphan id. The full subtree is walked on remove and selection is cleared if any descendant id matches.
- **`addBlock` / `moveBlock` validate `columnIndex` against the section layout.** Passing `columnIndex: 5` on a `"2"`-layout section no longer creates phantom columns persisted into JSON; out-of-range indices are rejected and `moveBlock` leaves the source intact.
- **Media-picker callers guard against post-unmount writes.** `ImageBlock`, `ImageToolbar`, `VideoToolbar`, and the custom-block `ImageField` now check an alive flag after `await onRequestMedia()`. Closing the editor mid-pick no longer triggers zombie `emit("update")` / pulse-ref writes on a torn-down component.
- **Keyboard shortcuts scoped to the active editor when two are mounted.** Each `useEditorCore` instance previously installed its own `document` keydown listener, so a single `Cmd+Z` fired both editors' undo handlers. The new `activeEditorTracker` routes shortcuts to the editor the user most recently interacted with (single-editor pages keep the original always-active behavior).
- **`MergeTagSuggestion` cancels its pending `requestAnimationFrame` on exit.** The reposition-after-paint frame previously ran after the popup tore down, pinning the Vue app and DOM nodes for one frame.
- **`useMergeTagField.insertMergeTag` no longer emits after the host component unmounts.** A scope-dispose flag now gates the post-`await requestMergeTag()` writes (emit + `isEditing` + `nextTick`).
- **`useFonts.loadCustomFonts` no longer flips `isLoaded` after dispose.** The post-`Promise.allSettled` write is gated by the same scope-dispose flag.
